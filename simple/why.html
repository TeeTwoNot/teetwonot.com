    <h1>This is what the web used to look like!</h1>
    <p>It might seem weird at first, after being used to browsing sites with amazing interactive graphics and smooth interfaces, but...</p>
    <p>This was actually what most websites looked like back when HTML was on version 1!</p>
    <p>The reason why there's a simple version of my website is because, in the rare event that someone is using really old hardware to access the web, they can visit this website really easily!</p>
    <h3>Some reasons that old hardware is capable of visiting this site are:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This website doesn't force HTTPS! Some older browsers unfortunately don't support it.</li>
        <li>This is pure HTML! There is no CSS and no JavaScript. It's as simple as it gets.</li>
        <li>It's nice and compact! Even a really old 56k dial-up connection can load this website pretty fast!</li>
        <li>That's about it!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, even though simplicity is awesome, complexity is awesome too, so if you're not using Netscape to access this wesbite, you should visit <a href="https://teetwonot.com">teetwonot.com</a></p>
